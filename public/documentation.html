          <li>Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)</li>
          <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</li>
          <li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites</li>
          <li>Allow existing users to deregister</li>
        </ul>
